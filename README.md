# Overview
This project is a Java clone of the classic arcade game Space Invaders. In our version, there are 24 invaders that heavily shell the ground. The player controls a spaceship and can shoot missiles to destroy the invaders.
# Gameplay Features
Invaders: There are 24 invaders that move horizontally and descend toward the player's spaceship.
Player Missile: The player can shoot missiles using the Space key. The player can only shoot another missile when it hits an invader or the top of the board.
Alien Bombs: Aliens randomly launch bombs towards the player's spaceship.
Bomb Launching: Each alien shoots a bomb only after the previous one hits the bottom.
# How to Play
Use arrow keys (left and right) to move the player's spaceship.
Press the Space key to shoot missiles and destroy the invaders.
Dodge the bombs launched by the aliens to avoid losing a life.
The game ends when all the invaders are destroyed, or the player loses all lives.

# Instructions for Running the Game
The Space Invaders Game project in Java recreates the classic arcade experience where players control a spaceship at the bottom of the screen, defending Earth from descending waves of alien invaders. Programmers utilize Java skills to implement player input handling, manage alien movement patterns, detect collisions, and render graphics, creating a fast-paced and addictive gaming experience reminiscent of the original Space Invaders.
